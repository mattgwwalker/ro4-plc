RO4 Commissioning
==================

Connect to the Wifi network with SSID PWCL_Rig2.  Connect to the PLC
at 192.168.1.91.

Using the Texmate Development System, compile RO4.bas and open the
port to the PLC.


To confirm communication:
-------------------------
 - add User/UserVariables/TT01 to the watch window
 - turn the watch on
 - check that the value for TT01 from the PLC matches the value on the
   LED screen.


To modify the state of a valve:
-------------------------------
 - ensure that the plant is in the stopped state (fd100StepNumber == 0)
   or in the "Manual Test Mode" state (set fd100StepNumber to 50)
 - the cmd variable (for example, V01cmd) sets the valve to one of three
   states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On
 - add the cmd variable to the watch window (find the variable under
   User/UserVariables)
 - turn the watch on
 - double click on the variable in the watch window
 - type the new value and press enter
 
Note that the valves require air pressure to function, and the system
NO LONGER checks that there is sufficient, or even any, air pressure.
Further, note that the valve may already be in the desired state.  To
check that it is working change the state from off to on and then to
auto.  If everything is working correctly, this should change the
valve position and then return it back again to its original position.


Check list of valves:
---------------------

Confirmation that a valve is working can be obtained by changing its
cmd variable to 3, then to 2, then to 1.  If the valve is working, it
will change state either two or three times, depending on its default
state.

The following valves exist, and should be confirmed as working for
commissioning:

V01 - Water isolation valve to feed tank
V02 - Bypass redirection valve (to drain or to feedtank)
V03 - Permeate drain isolation valve
V04 - Isolation valve to allow air out the top of the pipework when filling
V05 - Retentate drain isolation valve
V06 - Retentate drain isolation valve
V07 - Retentate drain isolation valve
V10 - Seal water isolation valve
V11 - Cooling water isolation valve



Buttons and  Lights:
--------------------

There are four push buttons with internal lights and an emergency stop
button.  The buttons are bits |PB01_I to |PB04_I and |ES01_I.  The
lights are |PB01_O to |PB04_O.






Level Transmitters:
-------------------

There is one tank on RO4, the feedtank.  The tank has a level
transmitter, LT01.

There is another possibility for an off-rig feedtank.  This would have
another transmitter, LT02, which would need to be plugged into a
socket underneath the control cabinet.





Pumps:
------

Pump 1 (PP01) takes product from the feed tank and "stuffs" it into the
retentate line.

Pump 2 (PP02) pumps the retentate through the membranes.

To run a pump, there is both a run signal and a run speed.  The signal
variable ends in 'cmd' (for example, 'PP01cmd') and the speed variable
ends with an '_SPD' (for example, 'PP01_SPD').

The speed variable is a percentage multiplied by 100.  So to set the
speed to 50%, set the variable to 50x100 = 5000.

{ CHECK ME:
The VSDs will ramp
the pump speed slowly to ensure that the pumps are not shoked by a
request to go from say 0% to 100%, or visa versa.

For pump 1, the VSD ensure a safe minimum run speed for the pump, thus
setting the speed to 0% does not stop the pump, but rather runs it as
slowly as possible in a manner that can be maintained without over
heating the pumps.  This is not the case for pump 2.
}


To run and to stop the pump, use the command variable.  Set the
command variable to one of three states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On

Make sure there is liquid in the feed tank or in the retentate line
before starting a pump as the pumps do not appreciate being run dry.





Flow meters:
------------

There are three flow meters, FT01, FT02, and FT03.  Their values can be
displayed on the LCD screen (press the down arrow until the appropriate
page is shown).

FT01 measures the permeate flow in L/h.  If the plant is configured
with just one membrane, it's possible that the permeate flow is so low
that this flow meter is unreliable.

FT02 measures the flow in the bypass line in L/h.

FT03 measures the retentate flow rate in L/h.




Pressure transmitters and switches:
-----------------------------------

There are three pressure transmitters, PT01, PT02, and PT05.  PT01 and
PT02 are displayed on the LCD screen.  PS04 is a pressure switch.

PT01 measures the pressure in the retentate circulation flow after the pump PP01.

PT02 measures the pressure downstream of the membranes.

PS04 is a pressure switch for the seal water on pump PP02.

PT05 measures the permeate pressure.




Temperature transmitter:
------------------------

There is one temperature transmitter, TT01.  It measures the
temperature of the retentate line (just after the pressure pump PP02).

{ CHECK ME:
When not stopped, there is a constant check on the temperature to
ensure the safety of the membrane.
}
